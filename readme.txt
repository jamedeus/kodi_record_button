This addon serves a webapp with a record button used to generate clips from currently-playing media.

The app can be accessed on any browser at http://<kodi-host-ip>:8123

While media is playing in Kodi simply hold down the button to start recording and release when done. A download button will appear on the page once the mp4 has been generated.
